# Field-Runners
I have made a simple development of the Field Runners game in C++ language in this project.

Attention: Due to the organization of files, these program probably won't compile;
To compile these program, write a new makefile or put all the .c,
.cpp, .hpp, .h, and makefiles in one directory.
